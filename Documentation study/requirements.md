### 4. Requirements should be prioritized 
How essential is a certian requirement? is it "_nice to have_"/"_Mandatory_", try use a simple ranking scale like '__Low__/__Meduim__/__High__'. which help in the __development phase__ to _prioritize_ that you should be focusing on.

### 5. Requirements should be testable
Testers should be able to __verify__ whether the requirements have been implemented correctly or not. so it's either a __pass__ or __fail__

### 6. Requirements should be consistent
